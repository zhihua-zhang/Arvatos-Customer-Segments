# Arvatos-Customer-Segments

### Software used to finish the project
In oreder to complete the Arvato customer segmentation project, I wrote Python code in jupyter notebook and conducted research on my personal computer with only CPU support. 

### Libiaries used during the project

In this project, I called a set of useful packages listed below:

1. Numpy and Pandas for scientific computing and dataset handling;
2. matplotlib and seaborn for visualization;
3. copy for avoiding undesired changes of variables;
4. os and time for IO and printing;
5. sklearn for building models and using lots of powerful tools.

### Reference materials

For the reference, I have read [this](https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/credit-fraud-dealing-with-imbalanced-datasets) and [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/handling-imbalanced-datasets-in-machine-learning-7a0e84220f28) beneficial articles to learn how to deal with class imbalance, and [XGBoost documentation](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to deeply understand and implement this powerful tool.

### Data acquisition instruction
Because the dataset is too large for uploading, we will **NOT** upload them. And they **CAN** simply be found in the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Bertelsmann/Arvato Project Workspace.
